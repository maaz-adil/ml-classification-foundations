# Machine Learning Classification – Foundations

This repository contains a coursework-based machine learning project completed as part of my Computer Science degree at LUMS.

The objective of this project was to apply fundamental machine learning concepts to a structured classification problem, focusing on data preparation, model selection, and evaluation.

## Problem Overview
The task involves predicting class labels based on a given dataset by identifying meaningful patterns in the input features. The emphasis was on understanding the end-to-end workflow of a classification problem rather than optimizing for maximum performance.

## Approach
The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Feature handling and preparation
- Training baseline classification models
- Evaluating performance using appropriate metrics
- Interpreting results and limitations

The implementation prioritizes clarity, correctness, and structured reasoning over complexity.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Supervised learning (classification)
- Data preprocessing and feature handling
- Model training and evaluation
- Practical application of ML fundamentals

## Notes
This project is academic in nature, but it reflects my interest in building reliable and interpretable machine learning solutions using core principles. It serves as a foundation for further work in applied machine learning and AI automation.
